 Project Idea – “Classroom Marks Manager” (Advanced Version)

Description:
You are building a mini program for a teacher to manage students’ marks for multiple subjects and do real calculations.

Requirements (Real-Life & Challenging):

Ask the user for number of students and number of subjects.

For each student, input marks for each subject (nested loop).

Use methods to:

Calculate total marks for a student.

Calculate average marks for a student.

Determine pass/fail status for the student.

Determine grading based on average (Excellent, Good, Needs Improvement).

Keep running class stats:

Highest total marks

Lowest total marks

Average marks of the whole class

Use break/continue cleverly:

If a student gets below 40 in any subject, mark as fail and skip grading.

At the end, print a summary table for the class:

Student number

Total marks

Average marks

Grade / Pass-Fail

Optional Challenge: Ask if the teacher wants to update marks for a student and recalculate totals/grades.
